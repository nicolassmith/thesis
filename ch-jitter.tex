\chapter{Techniques for reducing output mode cleaner beam jitter noise}

\section{Mechanical resonances of beam steering optics}

\section{WFS1 pointing!!!}

\section{Magnetic field coupling and feedforward subtraction}

%This was in my opinion the most important noise source that came with the inclusion of the OMC in LIGO
%The beam steering optics (TipTilts) had their suspensions modified several times to reduce beam jitter noise
%Ambient magnetic fields coupled to TitTilt magnets to produce n*60Hz beam jitter, a magnetometer and feedforward system was created to reduce this.
%Will include “sensitivity improvement over time” figure, showing eLIGO sensitivity change with each modification
