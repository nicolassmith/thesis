We use mechanical modulation and a lock-in detection method to detect any misalignment. This system directly detects the relation between the axis of the laser beam and the axis of the cavity and automatically aligns the cavity to the laser beam. We confirmed that the intensity of the reflected light from the suspended Fabry---Perot cavity can be minimized with this system. Automated control of the alignment of the large-scale detectors is also discussed.},

While thefrequency of a source laser is stabilized to a fundamental cavity mode resonance, phase modulation sidebands are applied at the off-axis mode frequencies. Asymmetrical transmission of the sideband at the frequency of each off-axis mode produces amplitude modulated optical signals and indicates the extent of the misalignments. Phase sensitive detection of these optical signals provides the error signals which are minimized by a control system that steers the input beam. In this way, optimum coupling of an injected source beam can be maintained to the fundamental mode of the resonator. This active alignment technique has demonstrated a sensitivity to tilts of 0.1 nrad/{\textsurd}Hz and to lateral beam displacements of 0.08 nm/{\textsurd}Hz in the ~1-Hz-1-kHz frequency range. These values correspond to 2 parts in 107{\textsurd}Hz for both the far-field divergence angle and the beam waist size. Such performance is within a factor of 2 of the shot noise limitation of the error signal measurement for a detected power of 160 {\textmu}W.},

On the other hand, a tilt of the input beam or a mismatch of the beam waist position to cavity waist position couples to these modes in quadrature phase.

As part of the upgrade to Enhanced LIGO, these modifications replaced the radio-frequency (RF) heterodyne system used previously. We describe the motivations for and the implementation of DC readout and the output mode cleaner in Enhanced LIGO. We present characterizations of the system, including measurements and models of the couplings of the noises from the laser source to the gravitational wave readout channel.

A piezoelectric driver on one of the interferometer mirrors was used to generate subangstrom (3 {\texttimes} 10-14-m) vibrations of known amplitude. The measured displacement sensitivity of the system in the kilohertz region was 1.3 {\texttimes} 10-14m/Hz1/2, which compares well with the calculated photon noise limit of 1.06 {\texttimes} 10-14 m/Hz1/2.

The goal for the strain sensitivity of the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO) is 10{\textminus}21 rms, integrated over a 100-Hz bandwidth centered at 150 Hz. We present the major design features of the LIGO length and frequency sensing and control system, which will hold the differential length to within 5 {\texttimes} 10{\textminus}14 m of the operating point.

  abstract={The Laser Interferometer Gravitational Wave Observatory (LIGO) operates a 40m prototype interferometer on the Caltech campus. The primary mission of the prototype is to serve as an experimental testbed for upgrades to the LIGO interferometers and for gaining experience with advanced interferometric techniques, including detuned resonant sideband extraction (i.e. signal recycling) and dc readout (optical homodyne detection). The former technique will be employed in Advanced LIGO, and the latter in both Enhanced and Advanced LIGO. Using dc readout for gravitational wave signal extraction has several technical advantages, including reduced laser and oscillator noise couplings as well as reduced shot noise, when compared to the traditional rf readout technique (optical heterodyne detection) currently in use in large-scale ground-based interferometric gravitational wave detectors. The Caltech 40m laboratory is currently prototyping a dc readout system for a fully suspended interferometric gravitational wave detector. The system includes an optical filter cavity at the interferometer's output port, and the associated controls and optics to ensure that the filter cavity is optimally coupled to the interferometer. We present the results of measurements to characterize noise couplings in rf and dc readout using this system.}

However, the experience in the currently running interferometers reveals several problems connected with a heterodyne readout, of which phase noise of the RF modulation is the most serious one. A homodyne detection scheme (DC-readout), using the highly stabilized and filtered carrier light as a local oscillator for the readout, is considered to be a favourable alternative. Recently a DC-readout scheme has been implemented on the GEO 600 detector. We describe the results of first measurements and give a comparison of the performance achieved with homodyne and heterodyne readout. The implications of the combined use of DC-readout and signal recycling are considered.}

  abstract={A network of large-scale laser interferometers is currently employed for searches of gravitational waves from various astrophysical sources. The frequency dependence of the dynamic response of these detectors introduces corrections to their antenna patterns which in principle can affect the outcome of the associated data-analysis algorithms. The magnitude of these corrections and the corresponding systematic errors have recently been estimated for searches of periodic and stochastic gravitational waves ( Rakhmanov M, Romano J and Whelan J 2008 Class. Quantum Grav. [/0264-9381/25/18/184017] 25 184017 ). However, the calculation of the detector response in that paper followed the traditional semi-rigorous approach which does not properly take into account the curved nature of spacetime. The question then arises as to whether the results will be the same if the calculation is done within the rigorous framework of general relativity. In this paper, we provide such a derivation of the response of the detectors to gravitational waves. We obtain the photon propagation time from the solution of the equation for null geodesics and calculate the corresponding phase delay by solving the eikonal equation for curved spacetime. The calculations are then extended to include phase amplification from multi-beam interference in Fabry-Perot resonators which play an important role in the formation of the signal in these detectors.}

Astrophysical estimates for compact-binary coalescence rates depend on a number of assumptions and unknown model parameters and are still uncertain. The most confident among these estimates are the rate predictions for coalescing binary neutron stars which are based on extrapolations from observed binary pulsars in our galaxy. These yield a likely coalescence rate of 100 Myr âˆ’1 per Milky Way Equivalent Galaxy (MWEG), although the rate could plausibly range from 1 Myr âˆ’1 MWEG âˆ’1 to 1000 Myr âˆ’1 MWEG âˆ’1 (Kalogera et al 2004 Astrophys. J. 601 L179; Kalogera et al 2004 Astrophys. J. 614 L137 (erratum)). We convert coalescence rates into detection rates based on data from the LIGO S5 and Virgo VSR2 science runs and projected sensitivities for our advanced detectors. Using the detector sensitivities derived from these data, we find a likely detection rate of 0.02 per year for Initial LIGOâ€“Virgo interferometers, with a plausible range between 2 Ã— 10 âˆ’4 and 0.2 per year. The likely binary neutronâ€“star detection rate for the Advanced LIGOâ€“Virgo network increases to 40 events per year, with a range between 0.4 and 400 per year.}

  abstract={We present direct upper limits on gravitational wave emission from the Crab pulsar using data from the first 9 months of the fifth science run of the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-wave Observatory (LIGO). These limits are based on two searches. In the first we assume that the gravitational wave emission follows the observed radio timing, giving an upper limit on gravitational wave emission that beats indirect limits inferred from the spin-down and braking index of the pulsar and the energetics of the nebula. In the second we allow for a small mismatch between the gravitational and radio signal frequencies and interpret our results in the context of two possible gravitational wave emission mechanisms.},

  abstract={We present direct upper limits on continuous gravitational wave emission from the Vela pulsar using data from the Virgo detector's second science run. These upper limits have been obtained using three independent methods that assume the gravitational wave emission follows the radio timing. Two of the methods produce frequentist upper limits for an assumed known orientation of the star's spin axis and value of the wave polarization angle of, respectively, 1.9 Ã— 10 â€“24 and 2.2 Ã— 10 â€“24 , with 95\% confidence. The third method, under the same hypothesis, produces a Bayesian upper limit of 2.1 Ã— 10 â€“24 , with 95\% degree of belief. These limits are below the indirect spin-down limit of 3.3 Ã— 10 â€“24 for the Vela pulsar, defined by the energy loss rate inferred from observed decrease in Vela's spin frequency, and correspond to a limit on the star ellipticity of ~10 â€“3 . Slightly less stringent results, but still well below the spin-down limit, are obtained assuming the star's spin axis inclination and the wave polarization angles are unknown.}

Under conditions in which dominant errors are static or vary slowly over time, the analysis permits a simple prediction of the spectrum of short-term cavity length fluctuations resulting from mirror-orientation noise. The resulting model is applicable to the design of mirror control systems for the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory, which will monitor separations between mirrored surfaces of suspended inertial test bodies as a way to measure astrophysical gravitational radiation. The analysis is verified by measuring the response of the Laser Interferometer Gravitational- Wave Observatory's 40-m interferometer test-bed to the rotation of its mirrors.},

  abstract={As the first generation of laser interferometric gravitational wave detectors nears operation, research and development has begun on increasing the sensitivity of the instrument while utilizing the existing infrastructure. In the laser interferometer gravitational wave observatory (LIGO), significant improvements are being planned for installation around 2007, increasing strain sensitivity through improved suspensions and test mass substrates, active seismic isolation and higher input laser power. Even with the highest quality optics available today, however, finite absorption of laser power within transmissive optics, coupled with the tremendous amount of optical power circulating in various parts of the interferometer, results in critical wavefront deformations which would cripple the performance of the instrument. A method of active wavefront correction via direct thermal actuation on optical elements of the interferometer is discussed. A simple nichrome heating element suspended off the face of an affected optic will, through radiative heating, remove the gross axisymmetric part of the original thermal distortion. A scanning heating laser will then be used to remove any remaining non-axisymmetric wavefront distortion, generated by inhomogeneities in absorption of the substrate, thermal conductivity, etc. A proof-of-principle experiment has been constructed at MIT, selected data of which are presented.}

  abstract={First generation gravitational wave interferometer performances were affected by thermal effects and non-optimal coupling of the light into several optical cavities. Slow thermally induced beam-wavefront distortions can be compensated using deformable mirrors driven by thermal actuators. We propose a new device, where the set of heating actuators is placed in direct contact with the reflecting surface of the mirror, enabling an efficient control of its refractive index and shape. This system is particularly useful for an in-vacuum environment, where low noise remote actuation is required. It is therefore well suited for Advanced Gravitational Wave Detectors where many optical cavities will require active optimal coupling for optimizing their quantum noise sensitivity without producing motion of the rest of the optics, which could interrupt the control acquisition sequence. In this paper, a prototype for such a thermally deformable mirror is described, and first results are presented. The proposed system promises to perform with good stability and efficiency.}

abstract = {Critically coupled resonant optical cavities are often used as mode cleaners in optical systems to improve the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of a signal that is encoded as an amplitude modulation of a laser beam. Achieving the best SNR requires maintaining the alignment of the mode cleaner relative to the laser beam on which the signal is encoded. An automatic alignment system that is primarily sensitive to the carrier field component of the beam will not, in general, provide optimal SNR. We present an approach that modifies traditional dither alignment sensing by applying a large amplitude modulation on the signal field, thereby producing error signals that are sensitive to the signal sideband field alignment. When used in conjunction with alignment actuators, this approach can improve the detected SNR; we demonstrate a factor of 3 improvement in the SNR of a kilometer-scale detector of the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory. This approach can be generalized to other types of alignment sensors.},

  abstract={In this paper, we describe the conceptual design for the suspension system for the test masses for Advanced LIGO, the planned upgrade to LIGO, the US laser interferometric gravitational-wave observatory. The design is based on the triple pendulum design developed for GEO 600—the German/UK interferometric gravitational wave detector. The GEO design incorporates fused silica fibres of circular cross-section attached to the fused silica mirror (test mass) in the lowest pendulum stage, in order to minimize the thermal noise from the pendulum modes. The damping of the low-frequency modes of the triple pendulum is achieved by using co-located sensors and actuators at the highest mass of the triple pendulum. Another feature of the design is that global control forces acting on the mirrors, used to maintain the output of the interferometer on a dark fringe, are applied via a triple reaction pendulum, so that these forces can be implemented via a seismically isolated platform. These techniques have been extended to meet the more stringent noise levels planned for in Advanced LIGO. In particular, the Advanced LIGO baseline design requires a quadruple pendulum with a final stage consisting of a 40 kg sapphire mirror, suspended on fused silica ribbons or fibres. The design is chosen to aim to reach a target noise contribution from the suspension corresponding to a displacement sensitivity of 10 −19 m Hz −1/2 at 10 Hz at each of the test masses.}

  abstract={The baseline design concept for a seismic isolation component of the proposed 'Advanced LIGO' detector upgrade has been developed with proof-of-principle experiments and computer models. It consists of a two-stage in-vacuum active isolation platform that is supported by an external hydraulic actuation stage. Construction is underway for prototype testing of a full-scale preliminary design.}
