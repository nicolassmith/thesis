We present a basic formalism to calculate the effects of misalignment and beam distortions analytically in an arbitrarily complex optical system, including coupled cavities and Michelson interferometer configurations coupled with cavities. The electromagnetic field is decomposed into a superposition of higher-order Gaussian modes, while misaligned and distorting optical components along with free-space propagators are represented by matrix operators that act on the state vectors in this basis. We show how to deduce useful alignment signals generally, in order to design angular control systems.},

The requirement for the alignment of optical components to the laser beam is crucial. We have demonstrated a servo system developed for a Fabry---Perot cavity whose mirrors are suspended independently. We use mechanical modulation and a lock-in detection method to detect any misalignment. This system directly detects the relation between the axis of the laser beam and the axis of the cavity and automatically aligns the cavity to the laser beam. We confirmed that the intensity of the reflected light from the suspended Fabry---Perot cavity can be minimized with this system. Automated control of the alignment of the large-scale detectors is also discussed.},

abstract = {We demonstrate a method for real time alignment of a Gaussian beam to an optical resonator. While thefrequency of a source laser is stabilized to a fundamental cavity mode resonance, phase modulation sidebands are applied at the off-axis mode frequencies. Asymmetrical transmission of the sideband at the frequency of each off-axis mode produces amplitude modulated optical signals and indicates the extent of the misalignments. Phase sensitive detection of these optical signals provides the error signals which are minimized by a control system that steers the input beam. In this way, optimum coupling of an injected source beam can be maintained to the fundamental mode of the resonator. This active alignment technique has demonstrated a sensitivity to tilts of 0.1 nrad/{\textsurd}Hz and to lateral beam displacements of 0.08 nm/{\textsurd}Hz in the ~1-Hz-1-kHz frequency range. These values correspond to 2 parts in 107{\textsurd}Hz for both the far-field divergence angle and the beam waist size. Such performance is within a factor of 2 of the shot noise limitation of the error signal measurement for a detected power of 160 {\textmu}W.},

We show that a translation of the input axis or a mismatch of the beam waist to the resonator waist size causes a coupling of off-axis modes which is inphase with the input field. On the other hand, a tilt of the input beam or a mismatch of the beam waist position to cavity waist position couples to these modes in quadrature phase. We also propose a method to measure these coupling coefficients and thereby provide a means to align and mode-match a resonant optical cavity in real time.},

As part of the upgrade to Enhanced LIGO, these modifications replaced the radio-frequency (RF) heterodyne system used previously. We describe the motivations for and the implementation of DC readout and the output mode cleaner in Enhanced LIGO. We present characterizations of the system, including measurements and models of the couplings of the noises from the laser source to the gravitational wave readout channel. We show that noise couplings using DC readout are improved over those for RF readout, and we find that the achieved shot-noise-limited sensitivity is consistent with modeled results.}

Photon-noise-limited performance was achieved using 80 {\textmu}W from a single mode Spectra-Physics 119 laser in a modified Michelson interferometer on a vibration isolation table in a quiet room. A piezoelectric driver on one of the interferometer mirrors was used to generate subangstrom (3 {\texttimes} 10-14-m) vibrations of known amplitude. The measured displacement sensitivity of the system in the kilohertz region was 1.3 {\texttimes} 10-14m/Hz1/2, which compares well with the calculated photon noise limit of 1.06 {\texttimes} 10-14 m/Hz1/2. This is the smallest vibrational displacement measured directly with a laser to date.},

The goal for the strain sensitivity of the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO) is 10{\textminus}21 rms, integrated over a 100-Hz bandwidth centered at 150 Hz. We present the major design features of the LIGO length and frequency sensing and control system, which will hold the differential length to within 5 {\texttimes} 10{\textminus}14 m of the operating point.

  abstract={The Laser Interferometer Gravitational Wave Observatory (LIGO) operates a 40m prototype interferometer on the Caltech campus. The primary mission of the prototype is to serve as an experimental testbed for upgrades to the LIGO interferometers and for gaining experience with advanced interferometric techniques, including detuned resonant sideband extraction (i.e. signal recycling) and dc readout (optical homodyne detection). The former technique will be employed in Advanced LIGO, and the latter in both Enhanced and Advanced LIGO. Using dc readout for gravitational wave signal extraction has several technical advantages, including reduced laser and oscillator noise couplings as well as reduced shot noise, when compared to the traditional rf readout technique (optical heterodyne detection) currently in use in large-scale ground-based interferometric gravitational wave detectors. The Caltech 40m laboratory is currently prototyping a dc readout system for a fully suspended interferometric gravitational wave detector. The system includes an optical filter cavity at the interferometer's output port, and the associated controls and optics to ensure that the filter cavity is optimally coupled to the interferometer. We present the results of measurements to characterize noise couplings in rf and dc readout using this system.}

However, the experience in the currently running interferometers reveals several problems connected with a heterodyne readout, of which phase noise of the RF modulation is the most serious one. A homodyne detection scheme (DC-readout), using the highly stabilized and filtered carrier light as a local oscillator for the readout, is considered to be a favourable alternative. Recently a DC-readout scheme has been implemented on the GEO 600 detector. We describe the results of first measurements and give a comparison of the performance achieved with homodyne and heterodyne readout. The implications of the combined use of DC-readout and signal recycling are considered.}
