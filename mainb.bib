The requirement for the alignment of optical components to the laser beam is crucial. We have demonstrated a servo system developed for a Fabry---Perot cavity whose mirrors are suspended independently. We use mechanical modulation and a lock-in detection method to detect any misalignment. This system directly detects the relation between the axis of the laser beam and the axis of the cavity and automatically aligns the cavity to the laser beam. We confirmed that the intensity of the reflected light from the suspended Fabry---Perot cavity can be minimized with this system. Automated control of the alignment of the large-scale detectors is also discussed.},

While thefrequency of a source laser is stabilized to a fundamental cavity mode resonance, phase modulation sidebands are applied at the off-axis mode frequencies. Asymmetrical transmission of the sideband at the frequency of each off-axis mode produces amplitude modulated optical signals and indicates the extent of the misalignments. Phase sensitive detection of these optical signals provides the error signals which are minimized by a control system that steers the input beam. In this way, optimum coupling of an injected source beam can be maintained to the fundamental mode of the resonator. This active alignment technique has demonstrated a sensitivity to tilts of 0.1 nrad/{\textsurd}Hz and to lateral beam displacements of 0.08 nm/{\textsurd}Hz in the ~1-Hz-1-kHz frequency range. These values correspond to 2 parts in 107{\textsurd}Hz for both the far-field divergence angle and the beam waist size. Such performance is within a factor of 2 of the shot noise limitation of the error signal measurement for a detected power of 160 {\textmu}W.},

On the other hand, a tilt of the input beam or a mismatch of the beam waist position to cavity waist position couples to these modes in quadrature phase.

We describe the motivations for and the implementation of DC readout and the output mode cleaner in Enhanced LIGO. We present characterizations of the system, including measurements and models of the couplings of the noises from the laser source to the gravitational wave readout channel.

Photon-noise-limited performance was achieved using 80 {\textmu}W from a single mode Spectra-Physics 119 laser in a modified Michelson interferometer on a vibration isolation table in a quiet room. A piezoelectric driver on one of the interferometer mirrors was used to generate subangstrom (3 {\texttimes} 10-14-m) vibrations of known amplitude. The measured displacement sensitivity of the system in the kilohertz region was 1.3 {\texttimes} 10-14m/Hz1/2, which compares well with the calculated photon noise limit of 1.06 {\texttimes} 10-14 m/Hz1/2. This is the smallest vibrational displacement measured directly with a laser to date.},

The goal for the strain sensitivity of the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO) is 10{\textminus}21 rms, integrated over a 100-Hz bandwidth centered at 150 Hz. We present the major design features of the LIGO length and frequency sensing and control system, which will hold the differential length to within 5 {\texttimes} 10{\textminus}14 m of the operating point.

  abstract={The Laser Interferometer Gravitational Wave Observatory (LIGO) operates a 40m prototype interferometer on the Caltech campus. The primary mission of the prototype is to serve as an experimental testbed for upgrades to the LIGO interferometers and for gaining experience with advanced interferometric techniques, including detuned resonant sideband extraction (i.e. signal recycling) and dc readout (optical homodyne detection). The former technique will be employed in Advanced LIGO, and the latter in both Enhanced and Advanced LIGO. Using dc readout for gravitational wave signal extraction has several technical advantages, including reduced laser and oscillator noise couplings as well as reduced shot noise, when compared to the traditional rf readout technique (optical heterodyne detection) currently in use in large-scale ground-based interferometric gravitational wave detectors. The Caltech 40m laboratory is currently prototyping a dc readout system for a fully suspended interferometric gravitational wave detector. The system includes an optical filter cavity at the interferometer's output port, and the associated controls and optics to ensure that the filter cavity is optimally coupled to the interferometer. We present the results of measurements to characterize noise couplings in rf and dc readout using this system.}

However, the experience in the currently running interferometers reveals several problems connected with a heterodyne readout, of which phase noise of the RF modulation is the most serious one. A homodyne detection scheme (DC-readout), using the highly stabilized and filtered carrier light as a local oscillator for the readout, is considered to be a favourable alternative. Recently a DC-readout scheme has been implemented on the GEO 600 detector. We describe the results of first measurements and give a comparison of the performance achieved with homodyne and heterodyne readout. The implications of the combined use of DC-readout and signal recycling are considered.}

  abstract={A network of large-scale laser interferometers is currently employed for searches of gravitational waves from various astrophysical sources. The frequency dependence of the dynamic response of these detectors introduces corrections to their antenna patterns which in principle can affect the outcome of the associated data-analysis algorithms. The magnitude of these corrections and the corresponding systematic errors have recently been estimated for searches of periodic and stochastic gravitational waves ( Rakhmanov M, Romano J and Whelan J 2008 Class. Quantum Grav. [/0264-9381/25/18/184017] 25 184017 ). However, the calculation of the detector response in that paper followed the traditional semi-rigorous approach which does not properly take into account the curved nature of spacetime. The question then arises as to whether the results will be the same if the calculation is done within the rigorous framework of general relativity. In this paper, we provide such a derivation of the response of the detectors to gravitational waves. We obtain the photon propagation time from the solution of the equation for null geodesics and calculate the corresponding phase delay by solving the eikonal equation for curved spacetime. The calculations are then extended to include phase amplification from multi-beam interference in Fabry-Perot resonators which play an important role in the formation of the signal in these detectors.}

  abstract={We present an up-to-date, comprehensive summary of the rates for all types of compact binary coalescence sources detectable by the initial and advanced versions of the ground-based gravitational-wave detectors LIGO and Virgo. Astrophysical estimates for compact-binary coalescence rates depend on a number of assumptions and unknown model parameters and are still uncertain. The most confident among these estimates are the rate predictions for coalescing binary neutron stars which are based on extrapolations from observed binary pulsars in our galaxy. These yield a likely coalescence rate of 100 Myr âˆ’1 per Milky Way Equivalent Galaxy (MWEG), although the rate could plausibly range from 1 Myr âˆ’1 MWEG âˆ’1 to 1000 Myr âˆ’1 MWEG âˆ’1 (Kalogera et al 2004 Astrophys. J. 601 L179; Kalogera et al 2004 Astrophys. J. 614 L137 (erratum)). We convert coalescence rates into detection rates based on data from the LIGO S5 and Virgo VSR2 science runs and projected sensitivities for our advanced detectors. Using the detector sensitivities derived from these data, we find a likely detection rate of 0.02 per year for Initial LIGOâ€“Virgo interferometers, with a plausible range between 2 Ã— 10 âˆ’4 and 0.2 per year. The likely binary neutronâ€“star detection rate for the Advanced LIGOâ€“Virgo network increases to 40 events per year, with a range between 0.4 and 400 per year.}

  abstract={We present direct upper limits on gravitational wave emission from the Crab pulsar using data from the first 9 months of the fifth science run of the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-wave Observatory (LIGO). These limits are based on two searches. In the first we assume that the gravitational wave emission follows the observed radio timing, giving an upper limit on gravitational wave emission that beats indirect limits inferred from the spin-down and braking index of the pulsar and the energetics of the nebula. In the second we allow for a small mismatch between the gravitational and radio signal frequencies and interpret our results in the context of two possible gravitational wave emission mechanisms.}

  abstract={We present direct upper limits on continuous gravitational wave emission from the Vela pulsar using data from the Virgo detector's second science run. These upper limits have been obtained using three independent methods that assume the gravitational wave emission follows the radio timing. Two of the methods produce frequentist upper limits for an assumed known orientation of the star's spin axis and value of the wave polarization angle of, respectively, 1.9 Ã— 10 â€“24 and 2.2 Ã— 10 â€“24 , with 95\% confidence. The third method, under the same hypothesis, produces a Bayesian upper limit of 2.1 Ã— 10 â€“24 , with 95\% degree of belief. These limits are below the indirect spin-down limit of 3.3 Ã— 10 â€“24 for the Vela pulsar, defined by the energy loss rate inferred from observed decrease in Vela's spin frequency, and correspond to a limit on the star ellipticity of ~10 â€“3 . Slightly less stringent results, but still well below the spin-down limit, are obtained assuming the star's spin axis inclination and the wave polarization angles are unknown.}

abstract = {The influence of angular mirror-orientation errors on the length of a Fabry-Perot resonator is analyzed geometrically. Under conditions in which dominant errors are static or vary slowly over time, the analysis permits a simple prediction of the spectrum of short-term cavity length fluctuations resulting from mirror-orientation noise. The resulting model is applicable to the design of mirror control systems for the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory, which will monitor separations between mirrored surfaces of suspended inertial test bodies as a way to measure astrophysical gravitational radiation. The analysis is verified by measuring the response of the Laser Interferometer Gravitational- Wave Observatory's 40-m interferometer test-bed to the rotation of its mirrors.},
