abstract = {In the long-baseline laser interferometers that are now under construction to measure gravitational waves, the alignment of the optical components with respect to the incoming laser beam is crucial for maintaining maximum phase sensitivity. We present a basic formalism to calculate the effects of misalignment and beam distortions analytically in an arbitrarily complex optical system, including coupled cavities and Michelson interferometer configurations coupled with cavities. The electromagnetic field is decomposed into a superposition of higher-order Gaussian modes, while misaligned and distorting optical components along with free-space propagators are represented by matrix operators that act on the state vectors in this basis. We show how to deduce useful alignment signals generally, in order to design angular control systems.},

abstract = {In the long-baseline laser interferometers for measuring gravitational waves that are now under construction, understanding the dynamical response to small distortions such as angular alignment fluctuations presents a unique challenge. These interferometers comprise multiple coupled optical resonators with light storage times approaching 100 m. We present a basic formalism to calculate the frequency dependence of periodic variations in angular alignment and longitudinal displacement of the resonator mirrors. The electromagnetic field is decomposed into a superposition of higher-order spatial modes, Fourier frequency components, and polarization states. Alignment fluctuations and length variations of free-space propagation are represented by matrix operators that act on the multicomponent state vectors of the field.},
