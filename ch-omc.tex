\chapter{The output mode cleaner}

\section{Motivation for an OMC}
The interferometer is supplied with a beam that has a very nearly pure Gaussian spatial profile thanks to the input mode cleaner. %NL%
The input mode cleaner is a nearly critically coupled resonant optical cavity which filters the beam supplied by the laser before it is delivered to the interferometer input. %NL%
The interferometer builds up power in the recycling cavity which is delivered to the long arms. %NL%
The arms further recycle the laser light and this large resonant field acts as the source field which gets modulated by a passing gravitational wave and pumps light into the audio sidebands which are finally detected as a signal. %NL%
Although the beam delivered by the mode cleaner is spatially very pure, the efficiency of coupling this beam to the final resonant mode of the arm is not ideal. %NL%
Components of the input light which are not matched to the mode of the arm cavity will not resonate and some of this unmatched light will exit the antisymmetric port along with the signal light. %NL%
The unmatched light at the antisymmetric port will exist as higher order modes (HOM) relative to the arm cavity mode and is often referred to as ``junk light.'' %NL%
The presence of this light on a photodetector will contribute photon shot noise. %NL%
Also, if the coupling is time dependent, the time variation of the junk light directly contaminate the signal with noise.

It is therefore desireable to be able to separate the junk light from the signal rich audio frequency fields originating in the arm cavities. %NL%
A natural form of spatial filter exists in the form of a critically coupled resonant optical cavity. %NL%
When placed at the output of the interferometer we refer to such a cavity as the output mode cleaner (OMC).

\infobox{The benefits of an OMC}{
\begin{itemize}
\item Reduce shot noise from HOM carrier fields
\item Reduce shot noise from RF sidebands
\item Reduce audio frequency noise from RF sidebands
\end{itemize}
}
It can be useful to point out that interferometers based on both RF and DC readout can benefit from an OMC \com{readouts discussed in previous chapter}. %NL%
Both the GEO and Virgo interferometers have used OMCs in an RF readout configuration, and LIGO experimented with an OMC before using DC readout \cite{some things}. %NL%
An OMC is especially important for a DC readout interferometer because any audio frequency modulation of fields that are not the local oscillator or signal will contaminate the readout. %NL%
Also, there is not benefit of the frequency selection of the RF readout to selectively omit unwanted audio modulation. %NL%
An OMC may also be used to ensure the light provided by the differential arm offset dominates the DC power present on the detection photodiode, otherwise DC power from other fields (such as the RF sidebands) will contribute to photon shot noise without increasing the signal strength. %NL%


Thus, for an interferometer which employs DC readout, the OMC should efficiently strip the HOM field components of the carrier field as well as the RF sidebands. %NL%
This is achieved by creating a high finesse cavity that is controlled to resonate on the desired (carrier) field. %NL%
The transmission of the off-resonant fields is goverened by the cavity finesse $\mathcal{F}$, explicitly the transmission is
\begin{equation}
Fineese-transmission,
\end{equation}
where.

The HOM field components experience an effective frequency shift relative to the \TEM{00} carrier field due to the Gouy phase shift. %NL%
The effective frequency shift is given by
\begin{equation}
gouy-freq-shift,
\end{equation}
where. %NL%

\section{Characterization of the H1 OMC}

\subsection{Cavity FSR and higher order mode spacing}

\com{Show diagram of OMC interrogator, and desribe experimental setup.}

Figure \ref{fig:OMCintdiagram} shows a diagram of the experimental setup used to measure the Free Spectral Range (FSR) and higher order mode spacing of the H1 OMC. %NL%
The laser source is a NdYAG NPRO providing a 1064nm wavelength laser beam. %NL%
A beam splitter sends some fraction \com{how much} of the light through an electro-optic modulator (EOM) which is driven at by RF oscillator \#1. %NL%
This introduces two RF sidebands which will be used for cavity length control. %NL%
The other path of light is director to an acouso-optic modulator (AOM). %NL%
The light is double passed though the AOM and and receives a frequency shift which is twice the frequency of RF oscillator \#2. %NL%
The light from the two paths are recombined before being injected into an optical fiber. %NL%
The frequency makeup of the combined beam includes the original carrier frequency, two RF sidebands and a frequency shifted subcarrier.

The light exiting the other end of the optical fiber is incident on the input coupling mirror of the OMC cavity. %NL%
The promptly reflected beam is detected on a photodetector where the photocurrent is demodulated at the frequency of RF oscillator \#1. %NL%
Choosing the correct demodulation phase provides a laser frequency error signal which is fed back to the frequency actuator of the laser. %NL%
The control system is able to maintain resonance of the laser in the OMC. %NL%
The laser transmitted through the OMC is detected on a second photodetector, as well as on a CCD sensor.

Measurement of the cavity FSR is acheived by varying the frequency of the subcarrier and measuring the OMC transmitted power. %NL%
The central maximum of the cavity resonance will occur when the shifted subcarrier frequency is equal to the FSR.

Similarly, the higher order mode frequency shift is measured by varying the subcarrier frequency until the subcarrier is resonant on a higher order mode of the OMC. %NL%
Coupling of the subcarrier beam into the HOMs is enhanced if slight misalignments are introduced on the input beam. %NL%
The order of the mode is determined by the image recorded by the CCD in transmission.

\com{data here.}

These data were taken with the OMC at room temperature. %NL%
It was discovered that the HOM spacing varied with the temperature of the thermal length actuator. %NL%
\com{Talk more about this? %NL%
it's own short section?}

\subsection{Finesse}

The frequency profile of the transmitted peak when the subcarrier is shifted through resonance may be used to determine the cavity Finesse. %NL%
The transmission as a function of frequency is
\begin{equation}
1+1=2.
\end{equation}

\com{data here.}

\subsection{Cavity losses}
The intra-cavity loss of the OMC was infered by using 3 photodetectors. %NL%
One measuring a sample of the input light, one measuring the reflected light, and one measuring the transmitted light. %NL%
Care was taken to ensure that the three photodetectors were calibrated relative to each other.

\com{data here.}

\subsection{PZT actuator response}
The PZT length actuator of the OMC was calibrated using by using the PZT to sweep the cavity through both carrier and subcarrier resonances while recording the PZT voltage. %NL%
The frequency spacing of the carrier and subcarrier is used to calibrated the PZT length actuation coefficient.

\com{PZT sweep figure here.}

The frequency response of the PZT actuator was measured at the error signal of the cavity frequency locking loop while driving the OMC PZT. %NL%
The effects of the control loop have been removed from the data.
