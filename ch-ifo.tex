\chapter{Gravitational wave antenn\ae{}}

\section{Experimental efforts to detect gravitational waves}
In 1960, Joseph Weber made the suggestion that an aluminum bar could be used as a gravitational wave antenna \cite{bar1}. %NL%
The idea being that as a burst of gravitational wave passes, it would induce a strain in the bar and excite the resonant mechanical modes of the bar. %NL%
For reasons detailed elsewhere\cite{bar2,bar3}, the scientific community was never able to verify Weber’s subsequent claims of detection\cite{bar4} although various theories\cite{bar5,bar6} were developed to explain the enormous apparent flux of gravitational wave energy.

In the subsequent years following Weber’s pioneering work, resonant bar detectors have improved greatly. %NL%
Modern bar detectors are cryogenically cooled, have much improved seismic isolation and make use of SQUIDs to readout the signal \cite{bar7}.

Using light waves to measure gravitational pertubations was first pointed out by Pirani in 1956 \cite{ifo1}. %NL%
It was only until 1971 that an early prototype interferometer was built in Malibu using an audio cassete recorder for data acquisition \cite{ifo2}. %NL%
Shortly after that, a study done at MIT by R. %NL%
Weiss identified almost all noise sources relevant for a kilometer length scale interferometer \cite{ifo3}. %NL%
It is these broadband laser interferometer based gravitational wave antenn\ae{} which provide the most compelling chance to directly measure these elusive waves.

\section{Measurement of optical phase}
In Chapter \ref{ch:gws} we introduced the idea that the waveform of a passing gravitational wave is imprinted on the phase of photons. %NL%
The frequency of ocillation of a laser with a wavelength of 1.064$\upmu$m is 2.8$\times 10^{14}$Hz. %NL%
There is no technology, currently concieved, with which one can directly measure the phase of electromagnetic waves at optical frequencies. %NL%
One may, however, convert the change of phase of the electromagnetic wave into a change of amplitude by means of the phenomenon of interference. %NL%
This is acheived by superposing two electromagnetic waves and measuring the power of the resulting wave, which is straightforward with the use of a photodetector (PD). %NL%


A device which exploits interference to measure phase changes of light is refered to as an \emph{interferometer}. %NL%
Modern interferometers use one or multiple lasers as the source of light. %NL%
Laser light is very well equipped for interferometry, is highly phase coherent compared to other light sources and a laser beam can often approach the minimum beam divergence physically allowed. %NL%
Types of interferometers include: Fabry-Perot, Michelson, Mach-Zehnder etc.

\section{Resonant optical cavity}
A resonant cavity, sometimes refered to as a Fabry-Perot (FP) cavity, is constructed with two partially transmitting mirrors placed in series. %NL%
When light is incident on the front, or input, mirror some is transmitted into the cavity. %NL%
As a steady state is approached, the light already in the cavity may interfere with new light which is being pumped through the input mirror. %NL%
When the circulating field is in phase with the incident pumping field, \emph{resonance} occurs. %NL%
For a linear cavity, this happens when the length is equal to an integer number of half-wavelengths of the light \cite{Siegman}.

\section{Pound-Drever-Hall reflection locking}
Pound-Drever-Hall (PDH) reflection locking is a powerful technique by which the resonance condition of a laser incident on an optical cavity may be controlled by use of a feedback control system \cite{PDH}. %NL%
In this control system, the error signal is a measurement of the detuning of the laser light from resonance. %NL%
In the case of a fixed length cavity, this may be understood as a measurement of the fluctuations in the laser wavelength. %NL%
We are instead concerned with a very stable laser source and a cavity which may change length due to external influences.\footnote{A gravitational wave changes the phase accumulated in the cavity, which is essentially interchangable with the optical path length of the cavity.} In this case, the error signal is better understood as a measurement of the length changes of the cavity.

As was shown in the previous section, the phase shift of the beam reflected from the resonant cavity is enhanced for fields resonant in the cavity. %NL%
However, for fields not resonant in the cavity, there is nearly no phase shift of the reflected beam. %NL%
The PDH sensing technique exploits this fact by contructing an input beam with frequency components that are both resonant and non-resonant. %NL%
By doing a relative phase measurement of the reflected fields, one may determine length changes of the cavity.

Creation of the input beam is done by sending the beam through an optical modulator. %NL%
This usually comes in the form of an \emph{electro optic modulator} (EOM), which is an optical device that has a electronically variable optical path length. %NL%
Applying a periodic electronic signal, usually at radio frequencies (RF), will induce a periodic phase modulation of the laser beam. %NL%
As will be discussed in Section \ref{sec:freqspace}, the primary result of this phase modulation is to impose new optical fields separated in frequency from the original field by the RF modulation frequency. %NL%
These new fields are usually refered to as \emph{phase modulated sidebands}, the central frequency component is refered to as the \emph{carrier}.\com{figure with carrier/sidebands and cavity? %NL%
also put modulation/demodulation block diagram} The modulation frequency is chosen such that the sidebands are not resonant in the cavity, and thus do not experience a phase shift when the cavity changes length. %NL%
Comparison of the constant sideband phase with the resonating carrier phase through interferometry yields a very sensitive cavity length measurement. %NL%


Because the modulator is varying the phase of the laser field, ideally there is no associated amplitude modulation. %NL%
Mathematically this is represented by the phase sidebands having an imaginary amplitude when compared to the carrier, they have a 90\degree{} relative angle in the complex phasor plane. %NL%
When the carrier is exactly centered on resonance, the reflected field experiences a 180\degree{} phase shift\com{plot with phase shift?}. %NL%
Thus the phase sidebands are still phase sidebands. %NL%
When the carrier is slightly detuned from resonance, the relative angle between the carrier and sidebands changes and what were once pure phase sidebands now have some amount of amplitude component. %NL%
Thus the power in the reflected beam now experiences a modulation. %NL%
Demodulating the power recorded by a photodetector in reflection will provide the desired length error signal.

\section{The Michelson interferometer}
The pre-stabilized laser and input optics systems provide the LIGO interferometers with an extremely stable light source with which to measure phase pertubations. %NL%
\com{it's still not good enough (quantitative)}. %NL%
To provide a phase sensitivity necessary to detect gravitational-wave it will be necessary to play a few tricks to hide our gravitational wave readout system from the noise still present on the input laser.

Using the analogy which treats the laser wavelength as a ruler with which one measures optical path length, there is an intuitive picture which shows why the correct arrangement of a Michelson interferometer may be made insensitive to fluctuations of your ruler. %NL%
Because the beamsplitter directs the same laser source to each arm, it is obvious that fluctuations of the laser wavelength (our ruler) will be identical in both arms. %NL%
This is a problem if one desires to measure the average length of the two arms, fluctuations in your ruler will directly cause fluctuations in your measurement. %NL%
If, instead, the differential arm length change is the desired measurement, ruler length fluctuations are supressed. %NL%
This may be shown quantitatively if we consider the propagation of the laser fields in the michelson interferometer.

\section{Michelson with arm-cavities}
One may exploit the common mode rejection of laser noise provided by the Michelson interferometer, while taking advantage of the high phase sensitivity of a resonant cavity, by joining the two designs. %NL%
The LIGO detectors acheive this by converting both arms of the Michelson each into resonant cavities. %NL%
This is heuristically similar to making a Michelson with much longer arms due to the phase gain of the arm cavities.

The resonance condition enforced by the control systems is that a half-odd integer number of wavelengths fit in the length of the cavity, or $L=n\lambda/2$ for some large integer $n$. %NL%
In terms of the optical frequency $f$ this is $L=nc/f$. %NL%
Thus if the control system holds the cavity on resonance by modifying the laser frequency, $\delta f$, and there is a length change $\delta L$,
\begin{align}
\delta L &= -\frac{nc}{f^2}\delta f, \\
\frac{\delta L}{L} &= -\frac{\delta f}{f}.
\label{eqn:dfdL}
\end{align}
Thus one may stabilize the frequency noise of a laser by locking the laser to some cavity. %NL%
Provided that the length of the cavity is sufficiently stable, this may be used to reduce the frequency noise of the laser below its intrinsic level. %NL%
Additionally, according to Equation \ref{eqn:dfdL}, this becomes more effective as the cavity is made longer.

This shows a trick one may play once the effort has been spent to build two arm-cavities. %NL%
We saw above that the common arm length of the interferometer may be difficult to measure due to laser frequency noise. %NL%
So it is not pracical to use the common arm mode as a gravitational wave sensor. %NL%
To not let effectivly half of one's interferometer go to waste, one may exploit this additional opical cavity as a stable length reference. %NL%
In the case of kilometer scale optical cavities, this provides a very stable frequency \com{quantitative statement here}.

\section{Power recycling}
Apart from the small fraction of light which is lost due to absorption or scattering, most of the light incident on a michelson interferometer operating on the dark fringe is reflected back from the input port toward the laser. %NL%
