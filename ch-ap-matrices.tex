\section{Collapsing a tensor of several indices into a 2D matrix}

% explain equation (6) in dynamical response. I believe there is a missing factor of 2 on a(r)

% you want to translate 4 indicies into 1, and it should be a 1 to 1 mapping

% the modal indices can be traversed diagonally nicely with (m+n)*(m+n+1)/2+n

% to expand, general formula i = p^(r^g[m,n]+r)+p. p^=2

\section{Define the free space propagator to have no phase rotation for the \TEM{00} carrier.}

% this defines the 'microscopic phase' to be zero, thus 00 carrier mode is always resonant in cavities. The higher order modes get the correct relative Gouy phase and the sidebands get their relative phase rotations. Can define another propagator to have 'microscopic phase' in order to set resonance condition of carrier

\section{Units}

% make the electric field have units of sqrt(W). Essentially choose units where epsilon_0 c / 2 = 1

\section{Calculating signal to noise ratios}
% for pupil function that is all ones, the shot noise doesn't change! that's useful. 

% general pupil functions? try for 5 minutes to calculate this.
