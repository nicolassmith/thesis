% what is the metric
Einstein described space-time as a four dimensional manifold which may be completely described by a metric tensor $\oper{g}$. %NL%
The space-time metric defines a co-variant interval between infinitesimally seperated events as
\begin{equation}
\dd s^2 = g_{\mu \nu}\dd x^\mu \dd x^\nu,
\end{equation}
where $\mu$ and $\nu$ are indicies for the space and time coordinates, and $g_{\mu \nu}$ are the elements of $\oper{g}$. %NL%
The trajectories of free particles are defined by geodesic paths in the manifold, which may be derived from the metric tensor\com{cite}.

The metric satisfies the sourced field equation
\begin{equation}
\label{eqn:einstein}
\oper{G}=\frac{8\pi G}{c^4}\oper{T},
\end{equation}
where $\oper{G}$ is known as the Einstein tensor and acts as a second-order differential operator acting on the metric tensor, $G$ is Newton's constant, $c$ is the speed of light, and $\oper{T}$ is the stress-energy tensor which holds information about all forms of energy in the space-time.\footnote{Further reading on the General Theory of Relativity can be found in \com{Schultz and Carrol}}

\section{The general theory of relativity in the linearized regime}
In the weak field limit of Genral Relativity, the metric tensor $\oper{g}$ will be close to the Minkowski metric of Special Relativity\com{citation}. %NL%
Far from sources of gravitational waves, the wave amplitudes will be quite small and thus
\begin{align}
g_{\mu \nu}&\approx \eta_{\mu \nu}+h_{\mu \nu}, &|h_{\mu \nu}|\ll 1
\end{align}

We are interested in Wave-like solutions that will propagate in the absence of any source terms (although they may be created by sources), thus $\oper{T}=0$. %NL%
For convinience we choose what is known as the \emph{transverse traceless} gague \com{write gague?}. %NL%
Given these simplifications, Equation \ref{eqn:einstein} becomes
\begin{equation}
\left(-\frac{1}{c^2}\frac{\partial^2}{\partial t^2}+\nabla^2\right)h_{\mu \nu}=0.
\end{equation}
This is of course the wave equation in three dimensions, which has solutions of the form
\begin{equation}
\oper{h}=\oper{A}\exp{(ik_\alpha x^\alpha)}.
\end{equation}
Due to symmetries and chosen gague conditions, a wave traveling in the $z$ direction with amplitude $\oper{A}$ has only two independant components\com{citation}
\begin{align*}
A_{xx}&=-A_{yy}\equiv h_+,\\
A_{xy}&=A{yx}\equiv h_\times,
\end{align*}
the rest being zero. %NL%
Thus a wave propagating in the $z$ direction takes the form
\begin{equation}
\label{eqn:wavefunc}
\oper{h} \doteq 
\ms
0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
0 & h_+ & h_\times & 0 \\
0 & h_\times & -h_+ & 0 \\
0 & 0 & 0 & 0
\me
\cos(\omega [z/c- t]).
\end{equation}
The following section examines ones of the physical observables of such a wave.

\section{The phase of a photon in the presence of a gravitational wave}
Presume we have a device which can measure the phase of a plane electromagnetic wave or alternatively, a photon. %NL%
The device is not under the influence of any external forces apart from gravity. %NL%
Suppose we send a photon in a particular direction, we have arranged for the photon to return to us with a system of mirrors and transceivers. %NL%
The total phase measured (modulo $2\pi$) of a photon with frequency $f$ after traveling along a path $\rm S$ is\footnote{The treatment given in this chapter assumes that the path taken by the photon is short compared to the wavelength of the gravitational wave, known as the `long wavelength approximation.' A fully consistent relativistic treatment is given by \citet{RakhmanovPhoton}.}
\begin{equation}
\phi_{\text{round trip}} = 2\pi f\oint_{\rm S} \dd t.
\end{equation}
Along the path, the photon follows a null trajectory ($\dt s^2=0$) and furthermore, according to Equation \ref{eqn:wavefunc}, the metric does not mix time and spatial components ($g_{0i}=g_{i0}=0$), thus
\begin{equation}
c\dd t = \sqrt{|g_{ij}|\dd x^i \dd x^j},
\end{equation}
where $i$ and $j$ only include spatial components.

Let us consider a simple path made of two segments, propagation from the origin $(0,0,0)$ to a point in the $x$ direction which is $L_x$ away $(L_x,0,0)$, and then back to the origin. %NL%
The phase along this path is
\begin{equation}
\phi_{\text{round trip}}^{\text{x-path}}= \frac{2\pi f}{c} \left(\int_0^{L_x}-\int^0_{L_x}\right)\sqrt{|g_{xx}|}\dd x \approx \frac{4\pi f}{c} L_x \left(1+\frac{h_+}{2}\right).
\end{equation} 
The same argument for a path along the $y$ gives
\begin{equation}
\phi_{\text{round trip}}^{\text{y-path}} \approx \frac{4\pi f}{c} L_y \left(1-\frac{h_+}{2}\right).
\end{equation} 

Instead, we may choose a path along the line $y=x$, in this case integration is taken along $ u(\sigma) = (\sigma,\sigma,0)$. %NL%
The phase obtained is
\begin{equation}
\phi_{\text{round trip}}^{\text{u-path}} \approx \frac{4\pi f}{c} L_u \left(1+\frac{h_\times}{2}\right).
\end{equation} 
Thus the effect of the $h_+$ amplitude is to differentially stretch paths in the $x$ and $y$ directions, while $h_\times$ stretches along axes $45 \degrees$ from $x$ and $y$. %NL%
 The stretching effect is proportional to the unstretched length, and thus is manifested as a strain.

\section{Sources of gravitational waves}
% just cite some source papers, also maybe give the canonical 10^-21 thing. No calculations.
Of the known physical forces, gravity is bar far the most feeble. %NL%
When Einstein first postulated the existence of gravitational waves, he thought their effects would never be detected.

The lowest mass-energy multipole moment that may source gravitational radiation is the mass quadrupole. %NL%
The lower moments, the mass-energy monopole and dipole are guaranteed constant by energy and momentum conservation respectively \com{cite}.

A system of two bodies in orbit is a splendid source of gravitational radiation. %NL%
The first evidence of the existence of gravitational radiation came from the Hulse-Taylor pulsar system which showed the characteristic loss of orbital energy due to gravitational wave radiation damping \com{cite}. %NL%
The waves emitted by this system will have a discouragingly small amplitude of \com{something}. %NL%


A more promising prospect for the creation of gravitational waves that may be measurable is that of compact object systems in their final orbits before merger. %NL%
