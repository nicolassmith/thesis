\title{Techniques for Improving the Readout Sensitivity of Gravitational Wave Antennae}

\author{Nicol\'{a}s de Mateo Smith-Lefebvre}
% If you wish to list your previous degrees on the cover page, use the 
% previous degrees command:
\prevdegrees{B.S., California Polytechnic State University, San Luis Obispo (2006)}
% You can use the \\ command to list multiple previous degrees
%       \prevdegrees{B.S., University of California (1978) \\
%                    S.M., Massachusetts Institute of Technology (1981)}
\department{Department of Physics}

% If the thesis is for two degrees simultaneously, list them both
% separated by \and like this:
% \degree{Doctor of Philosophy \and Master of Science}
\degree{Doctor of Philosophy in Physics}

% As of the 2007-08 academic year, valid degree months are September, 
% February, or June.  The default is June.

%% By default, the thesis will be copyrighted to MIT.  If you need to copyright
%% the thesis to yourself, just specify the `vi' documentclass option.  If for
%% some reason you want to exactly specify the copyright notice text, you can
%% use the \copyrightnoticetext command.  
%\copyrightnoticetext{\copyright IBM, 1990.  Do not open till Xmas.}

% If there is more than one supervisor, use the \supervisor command
% once for each.
\supervisor{Nergis Mavalvala}{Professor of Physics}

\supervisor[Thesis Co-supervisor]{Peter Fritschel}{Senior Research Scientist}

% This is the department committee chairman, not the thesis committee
% chairman.  You should replace this with your Department's Committee
% Chairman.
\chairman{Krishna Rajagopal}{Professor of Physics\\Associate Department Head for Education}

% Make the titlepage based on the above information.  If you need
% something special and can't use the standard form, you can specify
% the exact text of the titlepage yourself.  Put it in a titlepage
% environment and leave blank lines where you want vertical space.
% The spaces will be adjusted to fill the entire page.  The dotted
% lines for the signatures are made with the \signature command.
\maketitle

% The abstractpage environment sets up everything on the page except
% the text itself.  The title and other header material are put at the
% top of the page, and the supervisors are listed at the bottom.  A
% new page is begun both before and after.  Of course, an abstract may
% be more than one page itself.  If you need more control over the
% format of the page, you can use the abstract environment, which puts
% the word "Abstract" at the beginning and single spaces its text.

%% You can either \input (*not* \include) your abstract file, or you can put
%% the text of the abstract directly between the \begin{abstractpage} and
%% \end{abstractpage} commands.

% First copy: start a new page, and save the page number.
\cleardoublepage
% Uncomment the next line if you do NOT want a page number on your
% abstract and acknowledgments pages.
% \pagestyle{empty}
\setcounter{savepage}{\thepage}
\begin{abstractpage}
\input{abstract}
\end{abstractpage}

% Additional copy: start a new page, and reset the page number.  This way,
% the second copy of the abstract is not counted as separate pages.
% Uncomment the next 6 lines if you need two copies of the abstract
% page.
% \setcounter{page}{\thesavepage}
% \begin{abstractpage}
% \input{abstract}

\section*{Acknowledgments}

This thesis would not have been possible without the many people in my life that I am lucky to know. %NL%
I would like to express sincere thanks 
to my parents, who have supported my dreams and decisions since the beginning;
to my advisor, Nergis, for making the interests of her students a priority, and for being a bottomless source of scientific input;
to the rest of my thesis committee, John Belcher, Scott Hughes, and Peter Fritschel, for their helpful comments;
to my friends and professors at Cal Poly, your influence has shaped me to be the physicist I am today;
to Jeff, Kate, and Tobin, for being my brothers and sister in arms through the eLIGO odyssey;
to Chris, Thomas, and Tim, for teaching me so much during my early time at MIT;
to Sheila, Stephen, and Al Levine, for helping me take on the Part III general exam;
to Daniel Sigg, who first introduced me to LIGO, and remains a source of guidance and inspiration;
to Sam Waldman, for designing the OMC, and being an invaluable mentor;
to Mike Landry and Keita Kawabe, for their leadership during my stay at Hanford;
to all the scientists who worked on Enhanced LIGO, for making me feel part of a team, and their immense contributions to the project;
to the LIGO Hanford staff, for putting up with me;
to Corey (and Gomez and Gunner), for letting me crash, and for the wee dram;
to everyone on the \texttt{statmechsocial} list, for being a source of friendship in a new and foreign environment;
to Phil and Sarah, for making our home a welcome place to be, and for all the beers we've shared;
to Aviv, for letting me turn bolts in his lab to procrastinate while writing my thesis;
to Leo, for knowing GR (and Mathematica, and \LaTeX{}) so that I didn't need to;
and to Catherine, for filling my days with happiness and teaching me to enjoy life's small pleasures.

LIGO was constructed by the California Institute of Technology and Massachusetts Institute of Technology with funding from the National Science Foundation and operates under cooperative agreement PHY-0757058. %NL%
